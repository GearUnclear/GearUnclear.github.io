## CRITICAL: Content Editing Guidelines

**⚠️ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: PRESERVE ALL MEANING AND ACCURACY ⚠️**

This is a critical knowledge base that Housing Hope staff rely on for:
- Emergency response procedures and contact information
- Compliance with housing regulations and reporting requirements
- Accurate program enrollment and data management processes
- Crisis intervention protocols that could impact safety

### When Editing Content:

1. **NEVER change, infer, or modify the meaning of any text**
2. **NEVER make assumptions about procedures, contacts, or requirements**
3. **ALWAYS preserve exact wording of:**
   - Emergency contact information and phone numbers
   - Program requirements and deadlines
   - Compliance procedures and regulations
   - System-specific instructions and workflows
   - Any safety or crisis response protocols

4. **When in doubt, ASK QUESTIONS rather than making changes**
5. **Only make structural/formatting improvements - never content changes**
6. **Verify any updates with Housing Hope staff before implementation**

### Acceptable Changes:
- HTML structure and CSS styling improvements
- Navigation and user experience enhancements
- Image optimization and broken link fixes
- Performance and accessibility improvements

### NEVER Acceptable:
- Changing phone numbers, email addresses, or contact information
- Modifying procedure steps or requirements
- Altering program names, definitions, or criteria
- Updating timelines, deadlines, or compliance information
- Changing any text that could impact staff understanding or safety

**Remember: Staff depend on this information for critical housing and safety decisions. Accuracy is paramount.**
